Relationship: Modify

POST

# containers/:containerId/relationships:delete
> Deletes one or more relationships by passing an array of relationship UUIDs.

Note that when a relationship is deleted, it is “soft” deleted, meaning it can still be retrieved by using the search endpoints. See [GET relationships:search](http-relationship-service-v2-search-relationships-GET.md) for more information.

Note that in order to delete a relationship, you must have access to both entities in the relationship.

  Note that this endpoint is compatible with both BIM 360 and Forma projects.
